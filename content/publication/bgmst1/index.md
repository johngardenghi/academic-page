# Abstract.
abstract = "The worst-case evaluation complexity for smooth (possibly nonconvex) unconstrained optimization is considered. It is shown that, if one is willing to use derivatives of the objective function up to order $p$ (for $p\\geq 1$) and to assume Lipschitz continuity of the $p$-th derivative, then an $\\epsilon$-approximate first-order critical point can be computed in at most $O(\\epsilon^{-(p+1)/p})$ evaluations of the problem's objective function and its derivatives. This generalizes and subsumes results known for $p=1$ and $p=2$."
